# KickstarterRPGReport
A script to find the new RPG kickstarters in the last week and generate a Reddit style post promoting them
Reddit user u/Zelbinian does a [weekly post](https://github.com/Zelbinian/Kickstarter-Board-Game-Tracking) in r/boardgames doing this; we want to do similar for new RPG projects.  This could trivially be altered to perform similar by changing the base URL to query the boardgames category.

## How to Use
To run the script to generate a Markdown compatible output listed all the current Kickstarter Tabletop RPG projects run the commane
```
python3 kickstater_rpg_report.py
```
